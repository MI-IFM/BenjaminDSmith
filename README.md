### Welcome!

In May 2019 I graduated from **[Colorado State University](www.colostate.edu)** with an M.A. in Political Science (specializing in International Political Economy). I received my B.A. from **[Keele University](www.keele.ac.uk)**, located in the United Kingdom. 

My research focuses on the politics of trade and foreign investment, investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), and financial services. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the institutions that regulate the global economic system.  

The research I have conducted on foreign investment has been reported on by **[The NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/10/business/us-china-investment-cfius.html), [Huff Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2019/04/30/isds-canada-trade-ccpa_a_23719635/), [The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/commentary/article-canadian-investors-need-to-stop-suing-foreign-governments-over/), [Bilaterals.org](https://www.bilaterals.org/?canadian-mining-companies-are)**, and others. 

I have also published several articles on U.S. trade policy in **[The National Interest](https://nationalinterest.org/profile/ben-smith)**. 

Feel free to follow me on **[Twitter](www.twitter.com/benjamindbsmith)** where I occasionally enjoy posting things related to trade disputes and being a Brit abroad in the U.S.
