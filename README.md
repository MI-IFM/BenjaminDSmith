### Welcome!

In May 2019 I graduated from [**Colorado State University**](www.colostate.edu) with an M.A. in Political Science (specializing in International Political Economy). I received my B.A. from [**Keele University**](www.keele.ac.uk), located in the United Kingdom. 

My research focuses on the politics of trade and foreign investment, investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), and financial services. Broadly speaking, I am interested in the institutions that regulate the global economic system.  

The research I have conducted on foreign investment has been reported by The NY Times, Huff Post, The Globe and Mail, Bilaterals.org, and others. 

I have also published several articles on U.S. trade policy in [**The National Interest**](https://nationalinterest.org/profile/ben-smith). 

Feel free to follow me on **[Twitter]**(https://twitter.com/benjamindbsmith) where I occasionally enjoy posting things related to trade disputes and being a Brit abroad in the U.S. 

Any inquiries welcome at ben.smith@colostate.edu
